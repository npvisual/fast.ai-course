## Lesson 2 Homework : Reusing VGG

### Introduction

[Lesson 2 Homework - Training VGG](Lesson2/Lesson%202%20-%20Training%20VGG.ipynb) is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) that I created as a hands-on approach to the [fast.ai class](http://course.fast.ai) Lesson 2.  Specifically, the [last part of that lesson](https://youtu.be/e3aM6XTekJc?t=1h29m41s) was somewhat problematic for me.

### Reason for `get_data()` ?

Part of the problem was my lack of understanding for using `get_data()` defined in `utils.py`. The more I read and discovered about it, the more I thought it was completely redundant to the use of batches that's done in that same notebook.

In addition there was a huge amount of memory being taken while running that notebook, regardless of whether or not prediction and training were performed.

### Using batches

So after looking at some of the comments in the [Lesson 2 forum](http://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-2-discussion/161) I decided to *re-write* the section of the notebook that uses predictions from the VGG model to feed to a single layer linear model. I used `predict_generator()` to run predictions on the batches we already defined and completely dropped the in-memory import of all the images done via `get_data()`.

This worked out pretty well as memory was kept in check and the original intent of the lesson was, in my mind, still preserved.

Have fun going over it !
